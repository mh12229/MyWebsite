  <p>Fluorite is multi-colored mineral known for its powerful energetic healing properties and mesmerising physical beauty.
    <br>The fluorite stone received its name from the fluorescent luminance that it emits when held under certain angles of UV light,
    <br>giving it a magical glowing appearance.
    <br> This enigmatic crystal can be found in a wide variety of different shades and colors, and each of them are as captivating as the next. Fluorite has always been used to lower the melting point of metals during the production of aluminum.
    <br> The gemstone was traditionally used to remove impurities and as a flux to lower the melting of raw materials in steel production and aluminum smelting. </p>
  
 
  
  
  
  <h1>Geode Crystals</h1>

  <p>A geode is a hollow rock lined with an inside layer of sparkling crystals. On the outside, geodes appear nondescript and are easily overlooked.
       <br>However, cracking open a geode will display an array of colorful crystals. </p>
